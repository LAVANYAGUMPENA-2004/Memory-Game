Creating a memory game (also known as a concentration game) is a fun project that can help you practice your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. In this game, players flip over two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs. If the cards match, they remain face up; if not, they are flipped back over.


Memory Game Implementation


Features:


-->  Grid of Cards: A grid layout of cards that players can click to reveal.
-->  Matching Logic: Players can flip two cards at a time to find matches.
-->  Score Tracking: Keep track of the number of attempts or matches.
-->  Restart Functionality: Allow players to restart the game.

Creating a memory game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a great way to practice your web development skills. Below, I'll explain how the memory game works, including the structure, logic, and interactions involved in the game.



Overview of the Memory Game


The memory game consists of a grid of cards that players can flip over to find matching pairs. The game is won when all pairs have been matched. The main components of the game include:

1. HTML Structure: Defines the layout of the game.

2. CSS Styling: Styles the game elements for a better user experience.

3. JavaScript Logic: Handles the game mechanics, including card flipping, matching logic, and game state management.


How It Works
1. HTML Structure
   
The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the game. It includes:

--> A title for the game.

--> A container (div) for the game cards.
--> A button to restart the game.
--> A message area to display the number of matches found.


2. CSS Styling

   
The CSS file styles the game elements, including the cards, the game container, and the button. It uses grid layout to arrange the cards in a grid format and provides visual feedback when cards are flipped.


3. JavaScript Logic

   
The JavaScript file contains the core logic of the game. Here's a breakdown of how it works:


--> Card Values: An array of card values is defined, where each value appears twice (to create pairs).

--> Game State Variables: Variables are initialized to keep track of the game state, including the cards, the first and second card flipped, whether the board is locked (to prevent flipping more than two cards at a time), and the number of matches found.

--> Shuffle Function: A function to shuffle the card values randomly is defined. This ensures that the card positions are different each time the game is played.

--> Create Board: A function to create the game board is defined. It shuffles the card values and creates card elements in the DOM. Each card is assigned a data attribute for its value and an event listener for the click event.
